Acute Kidney Injury is one of the most common, most dangerous, and least discussed conditions in critical care. It develops rapidly, often silently, and by the time it's caught, the damage is frequently irreversible.

The numbers are stark. AKI occurs in 20–50% of ICU admissions worldwide. In its most severe form, it carries a mortality rate exceeding 50%. Survivors face elevated risks of Chronic Kidney Disease, dialysis dependence, and cardiovascular events for years afterwards.

Despite this, AKI detection in most hospitals relies on the same method it has for decades: periodic measurement of serum creatinine.

## The creatinine problem

Serum creatinine is the standard diagnostic marker for kidney function. But it has a fundamental limitation: it's a lagging indicator. Creatinine levels don't rise until roughly 50% of kidney function has already been lost. By the time a blood test flags a problem, the optimal window for intervention — fluid adjustment, nephrotoxin withdrawal, early renal support — has often closed.

This delay matters enormously. Research consistently shows that earlier AKI detection improves outcomes. A 2023 meta-analysis published in *Critical Care Medicine* found that biomarker-guided early intervention reduced the incidence of severe AKI by 16% and shortened ICU stays by an average of 1.4 days.

## The human cost of delayed detection

AKI is not just a clinical challenge — it's an economic one. The average cost of an AKI episode in a US hospital exceeds $40,000, driven largely by extended ICU stays, dialysis, and complications. Globally, AKI-related healthcare costs are estimated at over $200 billion annually.

But the human cost is what drives urgency. Every hour of delayed detection represents a narrowing window for effective treatment. Patients who develop severe AKI face:

- **4–8x higher mortality** compared to ICU patients without AKI
- **28% risk** of developing Chronic Kidney Disease within 3 years
- **Significantly longer** hospital stays and recovery periods

## Why the ICU is the right place to start

ICU patients represent the highest-risk population for AKI, and — critically — the most monitored. Of the 300 million surgeries performed worldwide each year, up to 25% result in ICU admission. Of those ICU patients, approximately 80% are catheterised, meaning urine is already being collected continuously. Yet this data stream is barely utilised beyond manual volume measurement.

The opportunity is clear: transform continuous urine collection from a passive process into an active diagnostic signal. By combining hardware that captures urine biomarkers with AI models trained on ICU patient data, it becomes possible to detect AKI in its earliest stages — when intervention can actually make a difference.

## Moving from reactive to predictive care

The shift from reactive detection to predictive monitoring represents a generational change in how we approach kidney care. Instead of waiting for creatinine to rise, clinicians could receive alerts based on multi-parameter analysis: urine output trends, specific gravity changes, and biomarker patterns that precede clinical AKI.

This is the problem Samaritan was founded to solve. Not by replacing clinical judgement, but by giving clinicians the data they need — earlier, continuously, and with the analytical power of modern AI behind it.

AKI doesn't have to be a silent crisis. With the right monitoring infrastructure, it can become a preventable one.
