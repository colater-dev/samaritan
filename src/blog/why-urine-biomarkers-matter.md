Every hour, in intensive care units across the world, nurses manually measure urine output from catheterised patients. They eyeball a graduated collection bag, write down a number, and move on. This ritual — essentially unchanged for decades — represents one of the largest missed opportunities in modern medicine.

## The case for urine

Blood has long dominated the diagnostic landscape. But blood draws are invasive, intermittent, and require laboratory processing. Urine, by contrast, is continuously produced and naturally collected in the roughly 25% of ICU patients who are catheterised.

More importantly, urine carries a rich profile of biomarkers that can signal organ distress far earlier than conventional blood-based tests. Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), and Interleukin-18 are just three of the validated urine biomarkers for Acute Kidney Injury — a condition that affects 20–50% of ICU patients and carries a mortality rate exceeding 50% in severe cases.

## Why the signal goes unread

The problem isn't that clinicians don't value urine data. It's that the infrastructure for capturing it doesn't exist. Current practice relies on:

- **Manual hourly measurement** — subjective, inconsistent, and labour-intensive
- **Delayed lab results** — by the time serum creatinine rises, kidney damage may be irreversible
- **No continuous monitoring** — unlike heart rate or blood pressure, urine output has no real-time tracking system

The result is a diagnostic blind spot. Clinicians are making critical decisions about fluid management and renal function with incomplete, delayed data.

## What continuous monitoring could unlock

Imagine a system that doesn't just measure volume, but continuously analyses urine composition — specific gravity, biomarker concentrations, flow rate — and feeds that data into predictive models trained on thousands of ICU patient trajectories.

Such a system could:

- **Detect AKI hours earlier** than creatinine-based diagnosis
- **Reduce false alarms** by combining multiple biomarker signals
- **Automate documentation** and integrate with hospital EMR systems
- **Free nursing time** for direct patient care

This isn't speculative. The clinical evidence for urine biomarkers in AKI prediction is well-established. What's been missing is the hardware and software to capture and interpret this data at the bedside.

## A foundational data source

At Samaritan, we see urine monitoring as far more than a niche application. Catheterised ICU patients represent the ideal starting point — a controlled environment with continuous collection — but the implications extend much further.

Urine biomarkers have shown promise in detecting sepsis, drug toxicity, cardiovascular stress, and metabolic disorders. As models improve and data accumulates, the same sensing infrastructure could power a comprehensive biomarker intelligence platform.

The body has been sending these signals all along. It's time we started listening.
