## Product: AroBag
- **Product name:** AroBag
- **Status:** Patent pending, pre-clinical trials. Cannot offer pilots yet — only register interest
- **Category:** Medical device + AI software (hardware + software combination)
- **What it does:** A smart urine monitoring bag designed for catheterized patients in ICU. Uses AI models for predictive alerts for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
- **Key value prop:** Potentially reduces patient mortality through earlier detection
- **How it works:**
  1. AroBag collects and monitors urine output in catheterized ICU patients
  2. Measures indicators like urine output, specific gravity, and other biomarkers
  3. AI models analyze data to generate predictive alerts for AKI/CKD
  4. Companion app uses computer vision to digitally transmit measurements
  5. Data integrates with hospital EMR systems
- **Cost position:** "A fraction of the cost" vs. current solutions (affordable comprehensive solution — no competitor offers this)
- **Assets available:** 3D renders and mockups available for website
- **IP concerns:** Specific technical details cannot be disclosed publicly until clinical trials complete — risk of larger funded players copying and filing competing IP

## Grander Vision
- **Not just a bag — building a foundational model for the human body**
- Urine is the most readily available biomarker (vs blood which requires drawing)
- Catheterized patients are the first data source/application
- AroBag is the entry point; the vision is a comprehensive biomarker intelligence platform
- This "foundational model" positioning resonates much better with investors in the current AI landscape

## Target Audiences (Priority Order)
1. **Investors / VCs** — primary audience for the website (funding is the most immediate need)
2. **Potential hires** — recruiting talent
3. **ICU clinicians and nurses** — end users, clinical credibility
4. **Hospital administrators** — purchase decision-makers

## Content Pipeline
- **White paper:** In development, will be available for download/lead generation
- **Publications/clinical education section:** Planned (following Fize Medical's model)
- **Cost calculator tool:** Planned — "AroBag will save you money — find out how much"

## Brand
- **Primary color:** Deep Navy #1C1C40
- **Assets available:** Logo + brand colors (no formal style guide)
- **Tone:** Clinical & trustworthy — clean, medical-grade, data-driven

## Clinical Context
- AKI occurs in ~20-50% of ICU patients
- AKI is associated with 50%+ mortality in severe cases
- Early detection (even hours earlier) dramatically improves outcomes
- Current standard: manual hourly urine output measurement (error-prone, labor-intensive)
- Urine biomarkers are increasingly validated as early AKI indicators

## Public Presence (as of Feb 2025)
- **Website:** samaritan.bio — basic single-page site with minimal content (this is what we're replacing)
- **LinkedIn (Raghav Behl):** Active, tagline is "Making India's most innovative medical devices"
- **LinkedIn (Karan Rao):** Profile exists at in.linkedin.com/in/raokaran
- **Press/Media:** No press coverage found — this is a gap the website should help fill
- **AroBag mentions online:** No search results for "AroBag" — the product has essentially zero online presence
- **NROG Jakkur:** Could not identify this as a known incubator — need to ask the founders what this is
- **Funding:** Very early stage — INR 1L authorized capital, ~50K revenue in FY2024. Likely pre-seed or bootstrapped

## Website Strategy (from kickoff call)
- **Two-page approach:**
  1. **Landing page:** Investor-focused, vision-driven, futuristic positioning ("foundational model for the human body")
  2. **AroBag product page:** Clinician/hospital admin focused, practical benefits, clinical credibility
- **CTAs:** Book demo, register interest for pilot (not "request pilot" — can't offer yet), download white paper, careers
- **Design direction:** Medical credibility with startup edge. Neuro-Sonic is the primary structural reference — deck-like, one idea at a time, animations that let you imagine the product. Fize Medical's color system (blue/white + neon accent) praised as "super cool" — borrow the logic, differentiate on palette. Outset Medical flagged as "too much information" — use for visual language only, not info density
- **Tools:** Raghav moving away from Lovable, strongly prefers Antigravity ("so much more powerful"). Gyan starting from own codebase, open to handoff that syncs later
- **Existing site:** "Underwhelming is putting it at best" — partly IP constraints, partly stage. Now they "have to start speaking." Raghav has a mock site with animations + renders that Karan trimmed down (Raghav more optimistic, Karan more pragmatic)
- **Key messaging pivot:** Don't lead with "AroBag replacement story" — lead with the grander vision. AroBag is the entry point, not the whole story.

## Market Context
- Market is nascent — Retia (Potrero) only since 2023, most devices capture limited parameters
- 99% of the market is still uncaptured — no affordable comprehensive solution exists
- Biggest funded competitor: Fize Medical ($30M Series A, Jan 2025)
- IP risk is real: larger players with more funding could copy and file competing patents

## Key Observations
- The company has **virtually no online presence** beyond the basic website and company registration records
- This makes the website redesign even more critical — it will be the primary first impression for investors AND hospitals
- Raghav's LinkedIn positioning ("most innovative medical devices") is strong — we should reflect this ambition
- The small capital and revenue suggests very early stage — the website needs to project more maturity than the company currently has
- "AroBag" returns zero results on Google — we need to build SEO from scratch
- The "foundational model" narrative is significantly more compelling for investors than just the bag story

## Notes
- India-based company, but AKI/CKD is a global problem
- The combination of hardware (bag) + AI (prediction) + software (EMR integration) is the differentiator
- NROG Jakkur address needs clarification — is it an incubator, lab, or office?
