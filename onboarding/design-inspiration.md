# Design Inspiration for Samaritan Bio Website

## Client Feedback (from meeting)

### 1. Neuro-Sonic — neuro-sonic.com ⭐ PRIMARY REFERENCE
Public Knowledge Studio portfolio piece. **Strongest positive reaction from client.**
- **Client feedback:** Feels "more like a deck" than a dense site. Always one clear piece of information at a time. Balances talking to end users and investors. Animations and visuals help you imagine the product before you've finished reading.
- **Why relevant:** Same constraints — medical device, limits on what can be said publicly
- **Borrow:** Deck-like structure, one-idea-per-section pacing, scroll-triggered animations, dual-audience balance
- **Key pattern:** Information hierarchy that reveals complexity gradually, never overwhelms

### 2. Fize Medical — fizemedical.com ⭐ COLOR + CONTENT MODEL
Biggest competitor ($30M Series A). **Client called it "super cool."**
- **Client feedback:** Color system praised — blue/white base (medical) with a neon accent that gives a startup/modern edge. Literature review / clinical education layout for white papers specifically called "super cool."
- **Borrow:** Color logic (medical base + bold accent), clinical education section layout, publications library structure
- **Key pattern:** Neon accent against sober medical identity = startup energy without losing clinical trust
- **Note:** Borrow the logic, differentiate on palette

### 3. Viz.ai — viz.ai (POSITIONING REFERENCE)
AI-powered clinical decision support for time-sensitive conditions.
- **Client feedback:** Mentioned as a positioning reference (AI-based detection) — no explicit design praise
- **Why relevant:** Same model — AI detects condition, alerts clinician to act early
- **Borrow:** Narrative structure (problem → AI detection → clinical action → outcomes), not visual design
- **Key pattern:** "How it works" 3-step process flow

### 4. Butterfly Network — butterflynetwork.com (PRODUCT PAGE REF)
Handheld ultrasound device with AI.
- **Why relevant:** Hardware device + AI, sold to hospitals
- **Design:** Apple-esque product photography, white/minimal, scroll-triggered animations
- **Borrow:** Product-as-hero photography, FDA badge placement, clean whitespace layout
- **Key pattern:** Device beauty shots that make medical equipment desirable

### 5. Outset Medical — outsetmedical.com (USE WITH CAUTION)
Tablo dialysis system — directly in renal/kidney care space.
- **Client feedback:** Visually "very nice" but "too much information" / "too much happening." Requires a lot of reading. Compared unfavorably to Neuro-Sonic on clarity.
- **Borrow:** Renal care visual language, product photography style
- **Avoid:** Their information density and text-heavy approach
- **Key pattern:** Neuro-Sonic's one-thing-at-a-time approach is the corrective

## Supporting References

### 4. Tempus — tempus.com
AI precision medicine platform.
- **Borrow:** Audience-segmented navigation, stat counters, dark-mode data sections, evidence library
- **Palette:** White + dark navy/charcoal + teal accent

### 5. Aidoc — aidoc.com
AI radiology platform.
- **Borrow:** Dual-audience strategy (clinicians + admins), ROI sections, integration messaging
- **Palette:** Deep navy + bright teal/cyan

### 6. Cleerly — cleerly.com
AI cardiac diagnostics.
- **Borrow:** Dark background + bright data visualizations, "AI sees what humans miss" storytelling
- **Palette:** Dark navy/black + vibrant gradient accents

### 7. Biofourmis — biofourmis.com
Remote patient monitoring + digital therapeutics.
- **Borrow:** Use-case segmentation, complete system story (device + platform + workflow), green color differentiation
- **Palette:** White + distinctive green/teal primary

### 8. Owkin — owkin.com
AI biotech for drug development.
- **Borrow:** Serif typography for scientific rigor, non-blue accent (coral), publications emphasis
- **Palette:** White + coral/salmon accent + dark navy

## Design Recommendations for Samaritan Bio

### Color Strategy
- **Primary:** Deep navy #1C1C40 (already chosen)
- **Accent direction:** Client praised Fize's neon green + blue/white combo. Follow the same logic — medical base + bold accent — but differentiate on palette. Consider a distinctive accent (teal, amber, or warm green) rather than copying Fize's neon exactly
- **Dark sections:** Use navy backgrounds for data visualizations and product demos
- **Light sections:** White/off-white for content and text

### Typography
- Headlines: Bold modern geometric sans-serif (large display size for hero)
- Consider serif for sub-headlines to signal scientific rigor
- Body: Clean sans-serif at 16-18px for readability

### Page Structure (Single-Pager)
1. **Hero:** Device + dashboard, bold value prop headline, "Book a Demo" + "Request Pilot" CTAs
2. **The Problem:** AKI stats (incidence, mortality, cost). Large numbers, minimal text
3. **How It Works:** 3-step visual workflow (Monitor → Detect → Alert)
4. **Clinical Evidence:** Outcome statistics, validation data
5. **The System:** Device + AI + EMR integration shown together
6. **Team:** Founders with credibility signals
7. **Contact / CTA:** Demo request form, pilot program inquiry

### Imagery Guidelines
- Invest in professional device photography (clean backgrounds, multiple angles)
- Real ICU settings, warm/desaturated clinical photography
- Data visualizations showing predictive analytics on dark backgrounds
- Avoid: generic stock photos, abstract AI imagery (neural networks, glowing brains)

### What to Avoid
- Overuse of blue (every medtech site does this)
- Dense text-heavy pages — client specifically flagged Outset Medical as "too much information"
- Multiple ideas competing for attention in the same section (Neuro-Sonic's one-at-a-time pacing is the standard)
- Abstract AI imagery
- Cluttered navigation (one product = focused site)
- Overpromising without evidence
